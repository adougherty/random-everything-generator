    <table name="Traits: The dragon is..." id="is">
        <value>A dire dragon seemingly mutated someway by fel energies. Larger and more violent than even most dragons.</value>
        <value>The runt of the litter. It’s smaller than average and weaker, yet more intelligent and stealthy.</value>
        <value>A new parent protecting its eggs. It is proud and excited for them but will protect them to the death.</value>
        <value>Part of a long family lineage of dragons and trying to live up to the expectations of that.</value>
        <value>The survivor of an attack that haunts it. Whatever this attack is deeply disturbs the dragon whenever anything similar happens, for example causing the dragon to freeze and panic around fire.</value>
        <value>One half of a pair of twins. Very connected to their twin.</value>
        <value>Fond of staying in human form. They live as a human, or similar race, living the normal life of a mortal and enjoying it greatly.</value>
        <value>A powerful wild mage. It uses its spells as breath attacks that often cause completely unexpected chaotic surges of magic.</value>
        <value>A powerful wizard who has a large tome of magic. It adores magic and tries to learn as much as possible.</value>
        <value>Tainted by fiends, becoming demonic. More evil than normal and the lord of many minor demons that do its bidding.</value>
        <value>Tainted by celestials making it holy and good. Worshipped by many due to its holiness.</value>
        <value>A fey dragon, giving it an attenuation to the feywild and an affinity to nature. It seems constantly surrounded by flowers and fairies and seems to be quite the trickster.</value>
        <value>Loves building, and has actually tried to make its lair into the perfect dungeon. It will eagerly lure in and tempt people into it. It would even be excited if someone survived the entire dungeon.</value>
        <value>Considers itself to be a mercenary hunting down either heroes or evildoers. It hunts down these people and fights them mercilessly.</value>
        <value>Fond of meditation and has spent years reaching inner enlightenment and tranquillity.</value>
        <value>Very eager to make friends. Although making friends for a dragon often involves ‘playing’ with them in ways similar to a cat playing with a mouse.</value>
        <value>Trying to become the most infamous dragon in the entire realm. Almost to the extent of making itself a brand.</value>
        <value>Part of a pair mated for life. They’re very unwilling to separate.</value>
        <value>Actually very stealthy. Will lay traps and bait an enemy and attack from the shadows.</value>
        <value>Undead but trying to cling to what it once was, and not lose its soul and its mind.</value>
        <value>Not afraid of using technology. It has learnt from Rock Gnomes various steam and clockwork powered technologies, and will create auto turrets to use in its fight.</value>

        <value>Has a cult of followers who worship them like a god. It of course loves this as it strokes their ego.</value>
        <value>Highly emotional and will go through manic swings with their emotions. Kind and caring one day, destructive the other.</value>
        <value>Connected to the environment around its lair in a great way, able to manipulate the surrounding area and protects it.</value>

        <value>Has an agreement with a monster hunting guild to kill those applicants that get annoying after they pay in their initial application payments.</value>
        <value>Respects mortals and smaller creatures. Sees meaning in all life, even something as small as an insect.</value>

        <value>Is very interested in medicine and will heal and fix up anyone near death, even those trying to kill them. They will then keep them in a dungeon until they regain strength.</value>

        <value>Likes to live in animal form, experiencing the wild. It has picked up many animal like traits due to this.</value>
        <value>Is extremely intelligent, or thinks it is. Tries to use its mind to solve problems. And of course thinks it’s better than everything else.</value>
        <value>Is very charming and charismatic. Will actually talk its way out of, or into situations.</value>
        <value>Was created by magic or some other source, not a blood born dragon. This makes it confused about its life and creation.</value>
        <value>Was raised by mortals. If they were kind, it loves mortals. If they hurt it, it caused a hatred for mortals that caused their madness.</value>
        <value>Is entirely insane. Perhaps caused by magic or some kind of drug abuse.</value>
        <value>Always flies, tries to touch the ground as little as possible. Even flies in its sleep floating above the ground.</value>
        <value>Never leaves the ground, despite having wings. Has learnt to burrow instead when it needs to fly.</value>
        <value>Is not particularly strong, but is extremely fast and agile. Able to dish out many attacks at one go that deal small but biting damage.</value>
        <value>Slow, lumbering… but deadly. When this dragon eventually gets to combat its blows are entirely destructive.</value>
        <value>Has a strange honour system, only ever wanting to fight when it follows its exact set of rules. When people break this honoured battle system, the dragon uses its true power and gets angry.</value>
        <value>The dragon is part of a large community of friendly or not so friendly dragons who send messages and gifts to eachother on a regular basis.</value>
        <value>Hibernates for centuries at a time… leading to a lot of confusion. Its snoring is so loud it is mistaken for wind.</value>
        <value>Tries to be the opposite alignment of its natural state… While it tries hard it still feels urges and can lose control.</value>
        <value>Considers itself a master bard and will write songs and music. They may be good, but dragons are not the best at singing or playing the lute.</value>
        <value>Cursed with vampirism. While this doesn’t work exactly the same it has given the dragon a huge hunger for blood.</value>
        <value>Cursed with lycanthropy. While it doesn’t work the same, the dragon is amazingly violent on a full moon and hades silver.</value>
        <value region_start="15" region_end="22" region_include="disease">Has a terminal disease and is either trying to help or hinder the world as much as possible in its dying days.</value>
        <value>Runs a shop to those that are strong enough to survive the trip through its lair to get there.</value>
        <value>Thinks itself an intelligent mastermind, a game master that plays with its pawns in one huge game, a game of dungeons and dragons.</value>
        <value>Follows ‘the law’ of the land. Very strenuously stretching laws to let it do what it wants.</value>
        <value>It will be kind to those that give it gifts that it deems exciting enough.</value>
        <value>quite the nymphomaniac. Which can be rather dangerous especially when it gets its eye on a party member.</value>
        <value>Endorses adventurers or mercenaries across the land, giving them funds to do things the dragon is simply to lazy to do.</value>
        <value>A glutton. For food, drink, just about everything.</value>
        <value>Full of Pride. As are all dragons, but this one has trouble looking away from the mirror.</value>
        <value>Greedy, more than most dragons. If anyone has any treasure in any way, the dragon needs it.</value>
        <value>Lazy. Why do anything when you can rest. It doesn’t want to bother any one as much as it just wants to sleep and be by itself.</value>
        <value>Vengeful. If someone slightly wrongs this dragon they will come at them, their children, their children's children as well as every town they have been through ever.</value>
        <value region_start="25" region_end="33" region_include="artifacts">Is protecting a powerful artifact of intense magical power.</value>
        <value>Lonely, and only wants to find friends.</value>
        <value>Bullies all the other dragons and monsters in the area, becoming their leader.</value>
        <value>Works intensely on illusions and creates illusionary traps and environments.</value>
        <value>Demands protection money and food from nearby settlements.</value>
        <value>Serious social anxiety and doesn’t want to talk to anyone.</value>
        <value>It in its human form is influencing the entire realm and doing dark dealings.</value>
        <value>It only leaves its lair during a certain season each year.</value>
        <value>It wants to die in such a way that legends and songs will be created after it. Will actually try and orchestrate this.</value>
        <value>Is sick. A dragon sneezing is a powerful, but embarrassing weapon.</value>

        <value>All famous art, paintings and statues. It will commission paintings of itself, and go to art shows in disguise.</value>

        <value>The frozen or petrified statuesque forms of adventurers that try to kill it. It will tell the tales of their attempts proudly and with great interest.</value>

        <value>Music. It constantly needs music playing in its lair, and gets very agitated if there is none.</value>
        <value>A zoo of various monsters and creatures. It aims to have two of every race at one point, a male and female.</value>
        <value>Buildings. This dragon hoards real estate and territory. In disguise it owns and buys land. The land is more important than the people that live there, but will help the people if it helps them get more land.</value>
        <value>Gemstones. This dragon has little time for money but loves gemstones. Preferably cut.</value>
        <value>A library of books and stories. Knowledge is its passion.</value>
        <value>Magical artifacts, from all across the world.</value>
        <value>A very beautiful mansion that it uses like a doll house, getting the finest appearance possible.</value>
        <value>People it deems interesting that are either enslaved or convinced to stay.</value>
        <value>Narcotics. The dragon loves to try different types of drugs, such as pipeweeds and psychotropic mushrooms. Of course it needs large amounts to work.</value>

        <value>Artisan jewellery that the dragon actually wears on its body.</value>

        <value>A flying island above the land. Lush or barren, still a very safe place for a dragon.</value>

        <value>An abandoned mine. The mineshafts are filled with minions to defend the dragon.</value>

        <value>A desert pyramid, surrounded by dangerous deserts.</value>
        <value>A giant tree. Perhaps dead, or in a lush environment, a tree large enough to hold a dragon is impressive.</value>
        <value>Underdark Caverns. The underdark can be a great place for a dragon that’s trying to hide away.</value>
