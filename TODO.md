These are improvements that I intend to make in the future. If you would like to help support my development, please check out my **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/darthcluck)**

Note: Random Everything Generator is currently in beta.

## [Bugs]

## [Version 1.0]
- Save NPCs to Character Sheets
- Save Stories to JournalEntries
- Save Items to ItemsDirectory
- Improve Markov generator to account for name lengths
- Add additional Markov sources for cities, dwarves, elves, etc
- Add API hooks
-- Get a specific result from the tables to feed into other modules
-- Open a saved story from API
- Add Chat hooks
- Source partial values from another tables. Ex: "A gold cloak." The color should come from another table. The cloak should come from a 3rd table
- Add "Catch Phrases," voice sounds, accents, manner of speach, vocal ticks, and physical ticks to the various npc tables (Patreon?). Thanks for /u/deadlyllama for the suggestion
- Allow for the tables to be weighted. See [Issue #6](https://github.com/adougherty/random-everything-generator/issues/6)
- Let users filter lists for their worlds. For example, only have certain races available in the race table, or certain classes.
- Consider: Having some system specific tables. Races just for 5e, or just for Pathfinder
- Split races off from mutations, such as vamprie, werewolf, etc.
- Make NPC gender rollable, and replace all he/she language with the appropriate gender in tables. And such references should agree with each other.
- Make pattern elements linkable (See ingredients/blood of a {dragon})
